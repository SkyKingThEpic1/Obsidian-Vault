I saw a humanoid monster with a squid-like face.

It didn't look like a monster with great strength. If I could sneak to it unnoticed, I could probably kill it easily.

I crawled closer, ready to slay yet another monster. Suddenly, it turned around and met my eyes.

My vision immediately turned black. Then, the darkness faded away from the light of fire. I gazed around me.

I thought I was pulled into hell. I saw a bleak landscape, with blood instead of water, and piles of corpses instead of mountains. There was only one man standing, surrounded by fire.

My eyes were drawn to that man, who stood alone, holding the lifeless body of a woman I didn't know.

He glared at me, and with a voice eerily similar to mine, he said:
"Seven. Watch out."

When I opened my eyes, I found my hands wrapped around the throat of the monster.
